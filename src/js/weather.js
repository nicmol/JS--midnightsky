/* Create a class called Weather
- Part 1 - Retrieve the weather information when the user clicks the buttobn
  - Create the constructor
    - initialize instance variables for the "state" of the app and the ajax call
        this.state = {
          zipcode: "",
          city: {},
          forecast: [],
          simpleForecast: [],

        this.apikey = "&units=imperial&appid=c59493e7a8643f49446baf0d5ed9d646";
    - initialize instance variables for UI elements
        the form
        the zipcode input element
        the weather list div
        the current day div
    - write the stub of a method onFormSubmit
    - bind the class to onFormSubmit
    - add a submit handler to the form that calls onFormSubmit
  - Write the method onFormSubmit.  It should
    - prevent the form from being sumbitted to the server
    - get the zip code from the UI and put it in a variable
    - call fetch with the url zipcode and apikey
      - when the response comes back THEN parse the json
      - when that finishes THEN 
        - set the city in the state object
        - set the forecast in the state object
        - set the simpleForecast in the state object 
            by calling the method parseForecast (see bottom of file)
        - set the selectedDate to null
        - clear the zipcode from the UI
        - call the method renderWeatherList and pass this.state.simpleForecast as the arg
  - Write a first version of renderWeatherList.  It has forecast (which is 5 element simplified forcast array) as a parameter.
    - console.log the value of forecast.
  - Edit the constructor to bind the class to the method renderWeatherList
END OF PART 1 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR APP
- Part 2 - Format ONE weather list item and the weather list as a whole
  - Write the method renderWeatherListItem
    - This method returns a template literal containing the html for the weather for ONE day.
      It gets called in renderWeatherList.  It has 2 parameters a forecastDay and an index.
      The forecastDay is a js object from the "parsed" version of the return from the weather api.
    - Format the weather information for one day on the html page.  At a minimum it should include
      - the month and day as well as the weekday
      - the high and low temperatures for that day
      - the element should be styled with weather-list-item as well
    - CUT the html for ONE day from your html page into the body of your method.
      - Enclose the html in ``.
      - Replace the hardcoded month and day, weekday, high and low temperatures 
        with template strings that use the properties of the forecastDay object
      - Return the template literal 
  - Edit the body of the method renderWeather list.  It should
    - Create the html for each of the weather list items.  Use the array method map to do this.
      const itemsHTML = forecast.map((forecastDay, index) => this.renderWeatherListItem(forecastDay, index)).join('');
    - Set the inner html of the weatherList element on the page to 
      - a div element styled with weather-list flex-parent
      - that contains the itemsHTML from above
END OF PART 2 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR APP
- Part 3 - Display weather details when the user clicks one weather list item
  - Write the method renderCurrentDay.  It takes the index of the day as it's parameter.
    - Format the detailed weather information for the selected day on the html page. Include at least
      - identifying information for the city as well as the date
      - description and icon for the weather
      - temperatures throughout the day
      - humidity and wind information
    - CUT the html for the weather details and paste it into the body of your method
      - Enclose the html in ``.
      - Replace the hardcoded text with data.  The data is in the state instance variable.
      - Set the innerhtml property of the currentDay element on the page
  - Add a click event handler to each of the weather list items 
    - add a loop to the end of the renderWeatherList method that adds the event handler
    - you'll have to bind the method renderCurrentDay to both the class and the index of the item
  - Write the method clearCurrentDay.  It sets the inner html property of the currentDay element to ""
  - Call clearCurrentDay at the end of onFormSubmit
END OF PART 3 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR APP
